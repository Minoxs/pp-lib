# PP Library

Basically, I wanted an easy way to have PP calculation in my programs.
Turns out, PP calculation is massively complicated.

This library aims to expose the core of difficulty and PP calculation in C++ and C code.

# Stolen Code

PP Calculation was totally yoinked from: https://github.com/ppy/osu-performance   
Adapted to suit a library-style compilation and use

Difficulty Calculation _will be_ transpiled from: https://github.com/ppy/osu-difficulty-calculator   

# Thanks

To ppy and the osu! team  
To @OMKelderman (developer of [SanDoku](https://github.com/omkelderman/SanDoku/tree/master/SanDoku)) for pointing me in the right direction
